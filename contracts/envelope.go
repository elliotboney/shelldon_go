// Package contracts defines the versioned Envelope/Job/Result types that are
// the uniform contract over sheldon's internal bus. They are passed as Go
// structs in-process and gob-serialized only at the worker wall (M3); this
// package proves the gob path now so that swap is a pure transport change.
//
// Binding invariants (ARCHITECTURE-SPINE.md):
//   - The header is closed: exactly id/v/kind/src/dst/turn_id (AD-11).
//   - Versioning is the v field + additive-only struct fields; never remove or
//     reorder, only append (AD-10).
//   - No credentials ever travel on the bus (AD-9, NFR8).
//   - This package imports no provider/LLM SDK (AD-1, NFR3).
