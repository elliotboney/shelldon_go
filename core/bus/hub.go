// Package bus is the core-owned, in-process message hub. core is the LLM-free
// supervisor root that hosts this hub (AD-1); edges communicate only through it.
//
// The hub routes contracts.Envelope values by Kind to a registered destination
// channel — point-to-point, no broadcast (that arrives with later event-kind
// stories). Envelopes are passed as Go structs with NO serialization (AD-4); the
// channel transport is swappable seed (channel now → UDS+gob at the worker wall
// in M3) and the Register/Publish API is transport-agnostic so that swap reshapes
// no caller. An unknown destination fails safe with ErrNoRoute — the hub never
// panics (AD-4).
