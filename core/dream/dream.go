// Package dream is the AD-15 dream cycle: a scheduled introspective worker turn
// that reviews pending learnings, promotes the durable/recurring ones into the
// curated markdown tree, and prunes the rest — so a learning the pet keeps
// re-observing becomes durable knowledge that grounds later replies (FR11).
//
// It reuses the machinery; it is not a new subsystem (AD-15). The dream is a
// turn-tier Job (core/turntier) submitted through the arbiter (≤1 in flight, AD-8);
// the worker dreams (one LLM call) and PROPOSES promote/prune memory-ops; core
// (this package's OnResult) APPLIES them — marking the learning promoted/pruned in
// sqlite and appending the promoted observation into curated markdown. The worker
// holds no store handle and never writes (AD-6); it receives the candidate
// learnings via the dream Job.Input, so no new worker→memory seam is needed.
//
// The sensitive-classification lane is OFF until Epic 5 (NFR6/AD-3): while
// sensitiveLaneEnabled is false the dream never classifies or routes anything
// sensitive — promotion always targets facts/about, never vault/ (which does not
// exist yet, and curated.WriteFile rejects regardless). The scheduler loop is
// unchanged: the dream registers as a plain scheduler.Job (Yui's condition, AD-13).
